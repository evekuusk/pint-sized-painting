<h5>From oil paints to web design to goldsmithing jewellery, tabletop and showcase miniature painting is the perfect destination of a widely varied creative career path.  </h5>
<p>My professional and extracurricular background is full of varying expertise in creative fields.  As a hobby, I have worked in oils-on-canvas for most of my life before expanding into digital painting as well, both of which with a focus of portrait and character illustration.  In 2011 I co-founded and taught at The Art Academy (TAA), a small online art school which grew to over 200 active students in its first year.  Later in 2012-2014, I attended George Brown College for goldsmithing and jewellery design.  </p>
<p>Shortly after the metalsmithing program, I took a career shift towards tech and web design with a focus on user experience.  I made a name for myself creating intuitive, navigable interfaces for a high-profile educational institution in Ontario.  After a few years of this, I began playing Dungeons & Dragons and found a great deal of satisfaction in the practice of painting my mini for the campaign.  Later, Warhammer: Age of Sigmar caught my eye and scratched a more specific strategic gaming itch I had been craving, as well as offered endless opportunity for building, customizing, and painting a huge selection of models.  </p>
<p>Finding the art of miniature painting was an experience close to kismet.  I am well versed in the care for excruciatingly small detail in 3D projects (and most experience doing so in precious metal materials, which have a very expensive margin of error), I have professional training in colour theory and design, and lastly it is a shameless and delightful nerdy activity.</p>
<p>I love every second of creating a unique piece, whether it is a single showcase model or batch painting a whole army.  While I offer a minimalist level of tournament-ready paint, I excel most in the detail work, bringing life and vision to your collection.</p>
